# Statistics
### Statistics is a method for producing convenient summaries of data which then enables us to make inferences about the unknown
1. descriptive statistics:
   - are used to provide meaningful summaries about data and observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative (i.e., summary statistics) or visual (i.e., simple-to-understand graphs).
   -  Examples: Mean, median, frequency table, pie chart, histogram, boxplot
2. inferential statistics:
   - are based on probability theory and are used to derive models and methods that can be used to draw conclusions from data sets.
   - Examples: Parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, regression, goodness of fit tests
#### Descriptive statistics
- **frequency table**: A data set having a relatively small number of distinct values can conveniently be presented in a ”frequency table”
- **relative frequency** : Consider a data set consisting of n values. If f is the frequency of a particular value, then the ratio f/n is called its “relative frequency”
-  Data from a frequency table can be graphically represented by a
   1. Line graph
   2. Bar graph
   3. Pie chart
   4. Histograms
-  **Mean**:  The “sample mean” designated by ¯ x is defined by sum of all values by number of values.
-  **Median**: The mid-value of sample data is known as Median.
   1. If n is odd, the “sample median” is the value in position (n+1)/ 2
   2. If n is even, the “sample median” is the average of the values in positions n/2 and ((n/2) + 1).
- **Mode** : The ”sample mode” is defined as the value that occurs with the highest frequency. If no single value occurs most frequently, then all the values that occur at the highest
 frequency are called “modal values”
- **Sample Variance**: The sample variance is based on the squares of differences between observed values and their mean. It shows how the data is distributed from the mean value.
   - Square root of variance is **Standard deviation**

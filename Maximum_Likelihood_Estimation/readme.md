- For Computerized analysis
- Methods to determine Estimated Parameters that maximise the probability (i.e, likelihood) of the sample data to fix a problem
  1. Assuming probability density function f which is the function of a continuous random variable and unknown parameters. i.e, f(X,a1,a2,..) where X is a continuous random variable and a1,a2,... are unknown parameters
  2. Conduct N experiments to observe X1, X2,......Xn random variables. Then the likelihood function is L(X1,X2,..... ;a1,a2,....) = product Pi(f(Xi;a1,a2,...))
  3. Apply logarithms to likelihood function to simplify the Equations.
  4. After the simplification of Equations, differentiate the logarithmic likelihood function with unknown parameters and equalize to zero to get Maximum Likelihood Estimator.

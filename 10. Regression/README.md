- There is a single response variable Y , also called the dependent variable, which depends on the value of a set of input, also called independent, variables x1, ..., xr. The simplest type of relationship between the dependent variable Y and the input variables x1, ..., xr is a linear relationship. That is, for some constants β0,β1,...,βr the equation
     Y =β0 + β1x1 +···+ βrxr

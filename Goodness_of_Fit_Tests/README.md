 Statistical tests that determine whether a given probabilistic mechanism is appropriate are called goodness of fit tests.


 ## GOODNESS OF FIT TESTS WHEN ALL PARAMETERS ARE SPECIFIED
 - Suppose that n independent random variables — Y1,...,Yn, each taking on one of the values 1, 2,...,k — are to be observed and we are interested in testing the null hypothesis
 that {pi, i = 1,...,k} is the probability mass function of the Yj. That is, if Y represents any of the Yj, then the null hypothesis is

           H0 : P{Y =i} = pi, , i =1,...,k
           whereas the alternative hypothesis is
           H1 : P{Y =i} != pi, for same i = 1,...,k

- The hypothesis would be rejected if α≥p-value.

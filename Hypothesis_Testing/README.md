# Hypothesis Testing

-  A statistical hypothesis is usually a statement about a set of parameters of a population  distribution. It is called a hypothesis because it is not known whether or not it is true.
-   A hypothesis that, when true, completely specifies the population distribution is called a simple hypothesis; one that does not is called a composite hypothesis.

## Test
- H0 = Null Hypothesis (already claimed or maintained)
- H1 = Alternative Hypothesis (to verify the claim)
  
## Errors
- It is important to note when developing a procedure for testing a given null hypothesis H0 that, in any test, two different types of errors can result.
- Type I error:
   - It is said to result if the test incorrectly calls for rejecting H0 when it is indeed correct.
   - Reject H0 from test results eventhough H0 is true
- Type II error:
   - It states that the results of the test calls for accepting H0 when it is false
   - Accepting H0 from the test result but actually H0 is false(that is H0 should reject)
